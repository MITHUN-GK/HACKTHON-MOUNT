Iron ore is stony sand minerals from which metallic iron ore can be mined 
economically. Iron usually occurs in the form of magnetite, hematite. It is the 
most important iron ore found in India, there is a lot of loss of iron ore while 
traveling from the mines to the end points, and it is difficult to manually classify 
the types of iron ore and the process takes a long time. To overcome these 
problems, we use advanced RFID technology with weighbridge tracking system 
and use GPS tracking system for transportation. For the classification of iron ore 
species, we use a preliminary object identification algorithm - YOLO V5. An 
approach to iron ore classification based on the visual texture of the ore particles, 
which changes with mineral content, has been proposed. For example: hematite, 
pellets, magnetite vary in color and shape. These graded iron ores travel on a 
conveyor belt with RFID tags through the mill. The RFID reader reads the tag 
and sends the data to the microcontroller for further tracking. Classified iron ore 
is loaded into trucks sealed with an RFID tag, and a GPS tracker is used to capture 
and track the vehicle on the IOT dashboard. The weight is also monitored by a 
load cell. Tracked and monitored data will be stored and displayed in the 
thinger.io dashboard. This is a new idea for the problems faced in the mines, 
which can be fixed by the above technique
